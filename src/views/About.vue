      <p>Hi. This is me in Hong Kong several years ago exploring the various Pokemon Centers
      and electronic shops looking for country exclusive joycons. I've always had a taste 
      for Asian culture and I think this photo sums up that interest perfectly.</p>
      <p> I remember sitting in the backseat of my parent's car at nighttime after a long holiday, 
        waiting for the flicker of streetlights to illuminate my Gameboy as I was desperately trying to 
        catch my first Pidgey on Pokemon Yellow. This was just how gaming was back then. I've always had a
        passion for gaming and its nostaglic qualities. What started as a hobby to improve the enjoyment of 
        handheld gaming for family & friends, slowly became a side hustle and something I love to do on the side.</p>
      <p> I had no idea how vast the retro gaming community was until I started this project - building these Gameboys
        are just a small part of the enjoyment I get out of doing this.  
      </p>
      <p> Due to the active community around this, I am able to source the best and most exciting
        Gameboy components and accessories from around the world and bring them to the UK. All products
        are hand built by me and customised to your spec. As this is a one man operation, the cost of the product
        is how much I value my time it takes to build each individual piece. I then ship everything First Class Signed For
        and no extra charges on top.
      </p> 
      <p> International postage is doable, just add an extra note when you get in touch.
      </p>
      <p>  This website is forever being changed and modified (also by me!) so please let me know if there's anything
        that doesn't work or to be improved.
